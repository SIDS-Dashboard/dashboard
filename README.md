Next meeting I'll share my screen and explain all this - easier than typing it out.

first step is to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - this basically lets us use JavaScript on our computer like we would use Python and allows us to download libraries similar to using "pip install".

once installed, open your command line and type: `npm install -g parcel-bundler`

Once you do that, clone this repository to your desktop. Open the folder in your cmd line and type   `npm install` -- this will install the current template I set up. 

finally, type `parcel index.html` and go to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/) - a map should show up. Check the index.js file to see the code for it.
